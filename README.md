Project Overview
The system processes environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, vegetation density) through a trained Random Forest model to generate a fire risk probability. It features a microservices architecture, a Redis caching layer for performance, and a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask), Java (Spring Boot)

Machine Learning: Hugging Face (Random Forest), Scikit-learn (for data processing)

Data & Caching: PostgreSQL, Redis

Infrastructure & Deployment: Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

APIs: REST

⚙️ System Architecture
EmberAlert is built on a microservices design for independent scaling and maintenance:

ML Inference Service (Python/Flask): A dedicated service that hosts the trained Random Forest model. Its sole responsibility is to receive data and return a prediction.

API & Business Logic Service (Java/Spring Boot): Handles all web requests, user management, and data ingestion. It communicates with the ML service via a REST API.

Caching Layer (Redis): Caches recent prediction results to reduce load on the ML model and achieve an 85% reduction in response time for repeated queries.

Persistent Storage (PostgreSQL): Stores all prediction history and user data, enabling time-series analysis of geographic fire risk trends.

This separation ensures that the computationally expensive ML model can be scaled independently from the business logic.

🗺️ Features
Real-Time Prediction: Achieves sub-200ms latency for risk assessment requests.

High-Performance Caching: Implements Redis to serve frequent, recent predictions instantly.

Historical Data Analysis: All predictions are logged to PostgreSQL, allowing for tracking risk trends over time.

Production-Ready Deployment: Fully containerized with Docker and deployed via a CI/CD pipeline on AWS.

📊 ML Model Performance
Algorithm: Random Forest (via Hugging Face)

Dataset: Trained on 10,000+ historical fire scenarios and environmental data points.

Input Features: 8 environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).

Accuracy: Achieves 85%+ accuracy in predicting wildfire risk.

🔧 Installation & Local Setup
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose

Python 3.8+

Java 11+

Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emberalert.git
cd emberalert
Run with Docker Compose:
The easiest way to run the entire system is using the provided docker-compose.yml file.

bash
docker-compose up --build
This command will build the images for the Flask app and Spring Boot app and start all services (App, ML Service, Redis, PostgreSQL).

Access the Application:
The main application API will be available at http://localhost:8080.
The ML service endpoint will be at http://localhost:5000.
